### The Purpose
It is painful to set up a starter from scratch when you want to develop a library, setting up all the tooling, 
knowing how to configure package.json, knowing the latest approaches. There are a few starters out there which IMO are too opinionated,  
are mostly based on Rollup and they are hard to pick up. This starter aims to be a minimal approach, comes with reasonable 
libraries and their minimal setup so that anyone can extend it to their needs with ease.
